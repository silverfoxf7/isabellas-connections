# Isabella's Connections

This is a fork of @weallwegot's Connections-inspired game, with the goal of adding a backend server that communicates with Google Sheets so that my kids can add more puzzles via a simple spreadsheet UI.

## To Run Locally:

```
cd react-connections-game/server
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then in a separate terminal window:
```
cd react-connections-game
npm install
npm run dev
```
